Simmons Hall is a dormitory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which
is home to 300 undergraduate students. It is notable for its unique
architecture, which features 5,538 small, outward facing windows. The goal of
this project was to turn a 6-by-6 set of those windows into an approximately
20-by-20 foot LED-based display which could scroll messages and display
patterns. The visibility of the display is optimal because Simmons sits alone
across from “Dorm Row” where almost all of the other undergraduate dorms are
located. The display is thus visible to well over a thousand undergraduates who
live across from Simmons. The windows LED project had been executed before in
2006, but most of the hardware was missing and the display had been used
relatively sparsely due to the lack of accessibility through a web or voice
interface.

This repository contains the Python which runs on Google App Engine and interacts
with the lower levels of the system, which are located in Simmons.
